# Prism Finance - Access Global Markets. Earn Yield. Stay Decentralized.

**The First Fully On-Chain, Autonomous, and Decentralized Tokenized Hedge Protocol on Hedera**

> **🏆 Hedera Ascension Hackathon Submission**  
> **Track:** Theme 2: DeFi & Tokenization - Main Track Submission

Prism Finance is building the fully decentralized currency exchange based on hedge-backed stablecoins. Our vision is simple: **make USD dollar yield accessible for everyone and every currency.**

## 🌟 Protocol Overview

**Prism Finance is the first entirely on-chain, autonomous, and decentralized tokenized hedge protocol built on Hedera.** It implements a **Productive Cash Carry (pCC) Delta-Neutral strategy**, utilizing HBAR as collateral to generate stable yields ranging from **8-15% APY**. The protocol's smart contract controller aggregates multiple sources of perpetual liquidity, allowing for permissionless rebalancing to optimize yield and manage risk effectively.

At the core of Prism Finance is the **Autonomous Collateralization & Risk Engine**, which systematically assesses all relevant risk factors to produce an algorithmic risk score. This on-chain risk engine enables automated responses to key metrics such as funding rates, collateralization ratios, and liquidation thresholds, setting a new benchmark for risk management in Hedera-based DeFi environments.

Users can hedge their HBAR and earn yields in major global currencies, including **US Dollars (pUSD), Euros (pEUR), British Pounds (pGBP), Japanese Yen (pJPY), and 8+ additional currencies**. By acting as a **Global Currency Exchange (CX)** for productive stable currencies backed by hedged HBAR, Prism Finance provides essential infrastructure for **zero-slippage forex operations** and supports the development of composable financial solutions within the decentralized ecosystem.

## 🎯 The Problem

### On-Chain FX Markets Face Critical Challenges

**On-chain Foreign Exchange (FX) markets are heavily USD-dominated**, while off-chain FX markets (traditional finance) are more balanced between different currencies. Today, our problem market is **$50 billion in volatile unhedged HBAR stake**.

**Proof of stake requires users to lock up volatile assets**, typically making them face opportunity and volatility cost. When users seek stability, oftentimes they flow through centralized avenues such as Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT.

### Three Critical Problems

1. **Idle Collateral Problem**: Traditional CDPs lock your capital earning 0% yield
2. **Manual Rebalancing**: Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) require users to actively manage price ranges & rebalance liquidity
3. **Liquidation Risk**: Volatile assets combined with debt create constant liquidation anxiety

### Why Does This Problem Exist?

- CLMMs require users to constantly rebalance and manage liquidity due to price fluctuations
- Most liquidity tends to be single-sided (from one large LP) and not efficiently distributed
- Users have to work too hard, and protocol ownership is too centralized to a few LPs
- Traditional CDPs offer no yield on locked collateral
- Volatile assets create liquidation risk when used as collateral

---

## 💡 The Solution: Revolutionary Triple-Innovation Approach

**We provide an alternative solution to USDC and USDT** — one that is stable, decentralized, and maintains the native yield paid by Hedera staking.

We do this by utilizing **HBAR as growth collateral** for on-chain delta-neutral positions, introducing **Prism currencies** — a one-click hedge primitive for the global financial market. The currencies are essentially **US dollar-pegged international currencies backed by a fully tokenized on-chain hedge position.**

### 1. Productive Cash Carry (pCC) Delta-Neutral Strategy

- Utilizes **HBAR as growth collateral** for on-chain delta-neutral positions
- **90% automatic hedging** via perpetual futures protects against volatility
- **Dynamic adjustment** on every deposit and withdrawal
- **Protocol-managed SHORT positions** eliminate liquidation risk

**Key benefit:** When HBAR price drops, your SHORT position gains value, offsetting collateral loss. Users sleep well during market crashes.

### 2. Collateral Yield Generation

- **13% APY** on deposited HBAR collateral (10% base + 3% liquid staking)
- Yield accrues **automatically** - no minting required
- **Industry-first**: Earn yield BEFORE borrowing (competitors = 0%)
- Funded by protocol fees (minting, burning, liquidations)

**Key benefit:** Your HBAR earns yield while backing synthetic assets. Capital efficiency + passive income.

### 3. Dual-Model Architecture

- **Vault (Debt-Based)**: Mint stablecoins with leverage, keep HBAR exposure
- **Assets Exchange (Ownership-Based)**: Buy/sell synthetic assets with no liquidation risk
- **Automatic liquidity rebalancing** via oracle-driven pricing
- **Stableswap algorithm** for pegged assets (currencies)

**Key benefit:** When prices change, users do not need to manually rebalance their positions — it is handled automatically. Different assets require different approaches. Stablecoins use debt model, volatile assets use ownership model.

## 🔒 Risk Management & Autonomous Oracles

To further deal with risk, we run **Lightspeed Attestation** with our new primitive: **Autonomous Risk Oracles**. We can take information from DEX, off-chain data, and even more on-chain data points to produce an **algorithmic risk score** which is then posted on-chain and verifiable with Merkle proofs.

Users can then verify at any point in time what the risk to the protocol was, and the protocol can react programmatically to any risk changes.
